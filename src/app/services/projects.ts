				<p> 
					This web application demonstrates server support and database, in addition to web componentization and layout in Laravel.
					A basic layout resembling <a href="https://www.medium.com" target="_blank">medium.com</a> was implemented.
					Laravel blades were used to break down the website into components, along with ensuring ease of routing.
				</p>

				<p> 
					Controllers and Eloquent models were implemented to hook up the client with a MySQL database, such that data could be persisted. 
					The application is hosted on Amazon EC2.
